# HDR10Plus-Tool

A modern GUI to parse HDR10+ and Dolby Vision dynamic metadata for use with video encoding.

Supports **MKV, TS, MP4, and HEVC** as inputs right now. Please open an issue if there is any inputs that are not accepted that should be.

Supports drag and drop in the input area.

If you open a file that has both HDR10+ and Dolby Vision you will see dual option panels. Choose which you would
like to extract and configure the settings. Everything else is handled for you.

At the moment the only configurable options there is under options is to automatically start the job queue upon
adding a job.

#### Supported Operating Systems

As of **v2.0** the app only **officially** supports **Windows** operating systems. I plan to add support for mac/linux in coming updates when I have time to test the configuration fully.

#### Note

As of **v2.0** the tkinter version of the app has been dropped. I have no plans to update/maintain that version of the app. However, I will leave it on the repository in the "tkinter" folder.
