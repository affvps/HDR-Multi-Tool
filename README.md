A basic GUI to parse MKV, TS, MP4, and HEVC HDR10/10+ and Dolby Vision dynamic metadata for use with video encoding

Program only supports the above formats for now, I will add support for more if I come across any.

Feel free to put an issue on the tracker here if the program should but doesn't support an input extension type

In the menu at the top, you can select 'Automatic' or 'Debug':

'Progress Bars' spawns new windows with progress bars and a read out

'CMD Shell (Debug)' will spawn a CMD shell and leave it open in order to read errors in the event you have one
